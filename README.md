# codeU-capstone-project

This capstone project will be a somewhat personal weather site/app . As I don't really have a huge need for a weather app but I continually find myself looking at the weather to see what kind of weather I will encounter as I'm driving to work, or do I need one jacket or 2, or  how to go about planning my days off.
 

So what about the site? 

** For first time accessing the site it will display a modal that will ask for your zipcode. **
It will have a minimal header with the text "Your weather" centered at the top of the viewport with the current time and date below that. Roughly 90% or so of the viewport will display a high def image representation of the current weather. The viewport width will be split into two sections. One will take more space and have a display of the temperature, location, an icon representing the current weather, and a high/low for the temperature that day. The other half will take less space and display information such as the hour-by-hour weather for that day. When you scroll down there will be another section that is split in half evenly. One side here will display a simple seven day forecast represented with a high/low for that day and some text stating sunny, partly cloudy, rain, snow, etc. The right side will display a random weather related joke, message, or something inspirational that is weather related. Below that will be the footer. The left side will display display the text "made with love by Josh owens" or something like that. The right side will have 2 links. Contact me, and about website. When You click the contact me link it will take display my socials on a seperate styled page, and the about website will take you to a styled page explaining the site similar to the README.md on the github.



I. Introduction
Objective: Develop a responsive web site/app analyzing and displaying weather conditions(both current and future).
Tools and Technologies: HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries), JavaScript, node.js, OpenWeather API, Express.js.
Goals:
Implement responsive design.
Integrate various web development features.
Utilize third-party APIs for data retrieval.
Ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly application.

II. Responsive Design
Implementation
Media Queries: Implement media queries to adapt the layout for mobile and desktop screen sizes.
CSS Grid and Flexbox: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.
Responsive Components: Ensure all components (graphs, forms, tables) adjust appropriately across different devices.

III. Feature Implementation
Selected Features
Feature 1: Use arrays and objects to store and retrieve information displayed in the app.
Feature 2: Use RegEX to validate user input and prevent an invalid input.
Feature 3: Retrieve data from a third-party API and display it within the app.
Backup Feature: Serve with Node.js.
Integration of Third-Party API
Weather API: Integrate a weather API to fetch and display current weather data as well as future weather data.


IV. Data Handling and Analysis
Data Storage and Retrieval
Store weather data in arrays or objects.
Implement functionality to update and retrieve this data as needed.


V. Advanced Features (Optional)
Form and Data Storage
Create a form to allow users to input data (e.g., location, city/state, or multiple locations) and retrieve relevant weather data.
Store submitted values using an external API.
Data Persistence
Persist data to an external API and make it accessible within the app, even after a reload/refresh.


VI. Project Development
Node.js Web Server
Set up a Node.js server using Express.js to serve the application.
Implement at least one route that the app uses (e.g., /weather).
Database Interaction
(Optional) Use MongoDB to store and retrieve weather data.
JavaScript Framework

VII. Review Process
Internal Review
Perform thorough testing to ensure the application meets all specified requirements.
Validate the responsiveness and functionality of all components.
External Feedback
Present the project to peers or mentors for feedback.
Incorporate feedback to refine and polish the application.


VIII. Documentation and Final Submission
Code Annotation and Documentation
Annotate code with clear comments and explanations.
Write a comprehensive README.md file covering:
Project overview and objectives.
Setup and installation instructions.
Usage guidelines and feature descriptions.
Data sources and API integration details.
Final Submission
Ensure the project is fully functional and well-documented.
Prepare the project for final presentation or submission to evaluators.

# Milestones and Targeted Due Dates:

 Week 1 - Github repo created w/ README.md file completed, Basic site structure/ file structure created and all flexboxes/cssgrids and images in place, bulk of text in place, and begin working on JavaScript functionality.

Week 2 - By the end of the week: HTML/CSS complete and fully responsive and semantic, Javascript is beginning to take shape with all HTML elements
being defined and ready to have user input inputted to them and most of the functionality in place and working, and the third-party API being worked on.

Week 3 - Continue to work on JavaScript functionality, set up my node server and get all dependencies downloaded and in the correct file, and make sure all API'S used are working as intende

Week 4 - Finish Javascript, ensure node is working as intended, double check API performance and that it is working as intended, and test as much as possible for compatability on different operating systems and internet browsers

Week 5 - Refactor code as possible, prep for submission, make sure code is as clean as possible and everything is working as intended across all platforms/browsers and is visually appealing.
